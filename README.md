# Password_Generator
A password generator that helps to choose a password for your account by answering some certain prompt and after generates a password based on the prompt that has been selected.


# Project Title

Week 5 assignment, we are required to create a code for a password generator
that generates password based on what the user selects



## Lessons Learned

- Some of the lesson i learnt was that if the iteration code is well bullt it can run into
a infinite loop which can use up your computer memory and cause you computer to freeze or
use more than enough computing power. 
- I also learnt how to use the .length method to check the number of values in an array
- The type of array that included in the datasheet was 2d array, which is an array that is
nested inside another array.
- so far i was able to complete on 1 out of the 5 tax that the program needs to perform,
i will keep trying and iterating until i get it right.
